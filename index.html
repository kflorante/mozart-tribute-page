      <ul>
        <li><strong>Jan 1756</strong> - Mozart was born in Salzburg Austria on January 27, 1756. He was the son of a court musician and reputable violin teacher, Leopold Mozart.</li>

        <li><strong>1762</strong> - The following year, Mozart and his sister travel to Munich and Vienna, performing for the court.</li>
        <li><strong>1763</strong> - Leopold Mozart takes his children to a number of European capitals, exposing them to the best music available. Young Wolfgang begins to compose his first pieces.</li>
        <li><strong>1768</strong> - In Vienna in 1768, Mozart writes his first opera, "La Finte Simplice".</li>
        <li><strong>1777</strong> - For several years as a young man, Mozart travelled throughout Europe composing. He was unhappy in Salzburg and left, while his father stayed.</li>
        <li><strong>1782</strong> - By 1782, Mozart had settled in Vienna, producing a number of operas and other compositions during this period. He also fell in love and married Constanze Weber at this time. He remained in Vienna for a number of years.</li>
        <li><strong>1786</strong> - Between 1786 and 1787, Mozart and his wife twice travelled to Prague for the premieres of two of Mozart's operas, first "The Marriage of Figaro" and later "Don Giovanni."</li>

        <li><strong>1788</strong> - Mozart's compositions began to sell more poorly around 1788. He continued to play, but concerts were less well attended.</li>
        <li><strong>1789</strong> - Between 1789 and 1790, Mozart composed "Cosi fan Tutte," and may have composed a piece for the coronation of Joseph II.</li>
        <li><strong>1791</strong> - After a period of financial struggle, Mozart found renewed success, first with "The Magic Flute." He began work on the Requiem, but did not complete it; the completed portions were performed only once, on November 20.</li>
